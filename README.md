# awesome-crafted-nodejs
Awesome list of well crafted Node.js packages.

## Why
I created this repository to list all packages that was crafted with the goal of answering needs with less dependencies (and better performance if possible). Most of the time, it means that the package will rather meet very specific needs instead of bringing together a lot features in one package.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This often results in reduced accessibility. (and sometimes harder API).

Packages that are on this list are often useful to replace popular packages (if they are matching your need for sure).
